## Using the provided market data, apply the cost of carry model, the Black-Scholes model, and Monte Carlo simulations to determine the fair price of a coffee option contract. Analyze how changes in supply, demand, weather, and geopolitical factors might impact your pricing.

Given:
Current spot price (St): $1.20 per pound
Risk-free rate (r): 2% per annum
Storage cost (d): 1% per annum
Time to maturity (T): 6 months (0.5 years)
Strike price (X): $1.25
Volatility (Ïƒ): 25% 

## ANSWER: python

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm


1. Cost of Carry Model to calculate futures price
# Given values
S_t = 1.20  # Spot price in dollars
r = 0.02  # Risk-free rate (2%)
d = 0.01  # Storage cost (1%)
T = 0.5  # Time to maturity in years

# Calculating futures price
F_t = S_t * np.exp((r + d) * T)
print(f"The fair price of the coffee futures contract is ${F_t:.3f} per pound.")

2. Black-Scholes Model to calculate call option price
# Given values
S_0 = 1.20  # Spot price in dollars
X = 1.25  # Strike price in dollars
r = 0.02  # Risk-free rate (2%)
T = 0.5  # Time to maturity in years
sigma = 0.25  # Volatility (25%)

# Calculating d1 and d2
d1 = (np.log(S_0 / X) + (r + 0.5 * sigma ** 2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)

# Calculating call option price using the Black-Scholes formula
C = S_0 * norm.cdf(d1) - X * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2)
print(f"The price of the call option is ${C:.3f}.")


3. Monte Carlo Simulation for Futures Price Estimation
# Simulation parameters
S_0 = 1.20  # Spot price in dollars
r = 0.02  # Risk-free rate (2%)
sigma = 0.25  # Volatility (25%)
T = 0.5  # Time to maturity in years
num_simulations = 10000

# Running Monte Carlo simulation
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
simulated_prices = S_0 * np.exp((r - 0.5 * sigma ** 2) * T + sigma * np.sqrt(T) * np.random.randn(num_simulations))

# Calculating the average simulated price
average_simulated_price = np.mean(simulated_prices)
print(f"The average simulated price of the coffee futures contract is ${average_simulated_price:.3f}.")
